        "When you submit a program, it will be run against a number of judging test cases and for each one, you will receive feedback, shown in a colored box: green for correct, and red for incorrect. Incorrect submissions are further differentiated by the type of problem: \n",
        "- X (incorrect answer), T (time limit exceeded), \n",

The first test case is typically the same as the sample case described in the problem statement, and you need to solve it correctly before you are given feedback on the remaining cases (which are not revealed during the contest, even though you receive feedback on whether you solved them or not). The judges reserve the right to add or remove test cases after the end of the contest, so it is still worthwhile to test your program even if it passes all of the cases during the contest."

You may therefore NOT use pre-written code or \"templates\" to get a head start on your coding, and you may not consult resources other than those that provide information about basic functionality of your programming language (e.g., syntax, library functions, input / output, etc.). (Note that this particular rule has been updated (as of December 2020) to be more clear and slightly more strict than in the past, so do not worry if on past contests you did not adhere to this rule precisely as written above).\n",

        "- Do not submit any code that behaves in a malicious way towards the grading machine (i.e., do not try to open network connections, intentially slow down the grading machine, etc.). The judging environment monitors activities and system calls to prevent forbidden actions. Submission of code must be done via the interface on the usaco.org website (i.e., by selecting your file and clicking \"submit solution\"); attempts to submit via other means (e.g., scripts that attempt to automate this process) are NOT permitted."

If you are using file input, do not specify a complete path name in your 'open' statement, just 'cow.in'. Note that filenames are case-sensitive. If the problem says 'cow.in' then you must use 'cow.in' since 'CoW.In' and 'COW.IN' will not work. Some programs write their output to a file named in the problem statement (e.g., 'cow.out'); do not specify a path name in your 'open' statement, just 'cow.out'. Like the input filenames, output filenames are case-sensitive. If a problem uses file input / output, then output written to stdout or stderr will not be graded. \n",
